Note that initial positions as red crosses indicates the resulting fit was not satisfactory, e.g. if the uncertainty on the fitted parameter is large than the pitch of the grid. The gray lines indicates what initial positions led to a local minima. Ideally, one wants ~3 initial positions per minima to ensure that the space was samples correctly.\n",
